# Deploy A ReactJS App with Gitlab(Self-hosted) CI/CD

This article is mainly referred from [GitLab CI/CD example with a dockerized ReactJS App 🚀](https://dev.to/christianmontero/gitlab-ci-cd-example-with-a-dockerized-reactjs-app-1cda), I just made some personalized changes for my notes as learning purpose.

## 1. Setup a Gitlab service on a server

Your can follow [Gitlab Installation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://github.com/PFTian/TechNotes/blob/master/Gitlab/Gitlab%20Installation.md) or [offical document](https://about.gitlab.com/install/#ubuntu) to install Gitlab on a new Ubuntu server.

Basically we just need to do

- Install and configure the necessary dependencies

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y curl openssh-server ca-certificates tzdata perl
  ```

- Install Postfix

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y postfix
  ```

  Choose `Internet Site` and use your server's external DNS as `mail name`.

- Add the GitLab package repository and install the package

  ```bash
  curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
  ```

  Use your domain name as parameter to install the gitlab

  ```bash
  sudo EXTERNAL_URL="https://gitlab.yourdomain.com" apt-get install gitlab-ee
  ```

## 2. Install a Gitlab Runner (Better on A Seperate Machine)

Gitlab runner is an application that runs Giltab jobs in pipelines

> You should install GitLab Runner on a machine that’s separate from the one that hosts the GitLab instance for security and performance reasons.

You can follow [Gitlab Runner Installation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://github.com/PFTian/TechNotes/blob/master/Gitlab/Gitlab%20Runner%20Installation%20on%20Ubuntu%2020.04%20LTS.md) or [offical document](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/linux-manually.html) to install gitlab runner on a seperate Ubuntu server.

Simply you just need to do

- Download the latest `deb` file

  ```bash
  curl -LJO https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/deb/gitlab-runner_amd64.deb
  ```

- Install the package
  ```bash
  sudo dpkg -i gitlab-runner_amd64.deb
  ```
- Register your runner with command
  ```bash
  sudo gitlab-runner register
  ```
- Enter your Gitlab instance URL
  ```
  Please enter the gitlab-ci coordinator URL (e.g. https://gitlab.com )
  https://gitlab.yourdomain.com
  ```
- Enter the token you obtained to register the Runner:
  ```
  Please enter the gitlab-ci token for this runner
  Register Token
  ```

## 3. Create a New Project on Gitlab

Login to your Gitlab and create a new project (I will name it bright-future)

- Click `New project`
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116002743-bd9f3980-a62d-11eb-9894-92f2c62dd49c.png)

- Choose `Create blank project`
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116002892-4f0eab80-a62e-11eb-8182-b874f968df9d.png)

- Fill the project information and click `Create project`
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116002834-166ed200-a62e-11eb-8fcc-e9bac09df966.png)

## 3. Create a ReactJS Application and Push to Gitlab repository

- On your local machine, initialise a project called `bright-future` as well.

  ```bash
  npx create-react-app bright-future
  ```

- After creating the project successfully, we run the project
  ```bash
  cd bright-future
  npm start
  ```
- If everything is install correctly, you will see a default webpage shows as below on http://localhost:3000/
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116003343-17a0fe80-a630-11eb-8d46-049737f2f283.png)

- Check test passes
  Run the `test` command

  ```
  npm test
  ```

  In the console prompt, press `a` to run all tests, if everything goes well, we will see

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116003979-41a7f000-a633-11eb-95bd-e1d7a69797e2.png)

- Push the project to your Gitlab repository
  ```bash
  git init
  git remote add origin https://gitlab.yourdomain.cn/root/bright-future.git
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git push -u origin master
  ```
- Refresh the Gitlab repository, you will see your `Bright Future` has been listed there.
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116003800-2dafbe80-a632-11eb-9136-411848b6ce11.png)

## 4. Dockerize our application on Nginx

We will use [Docker multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) to create a Nginx image with compiled app in the end. You can obviously choose to use Nodejs image to run your app in a docker container, but using Ngnix image to deploy app is a thinner and more efficient way.

- Add `.dockerignore` for `node_modules` folder at the root of your `bright-future` project, since this file is usually huge and docker can help you download all the dependencies.

- Create a `Dockerfile` and add a build stage

  Since ReactJS application is based on Node.js, we still Node.js to build and compile the application.

  At the build stage, add the below code to the `Dockerfile`

  ```dockerfile
  # Build stage: based on Node.js, build and compile the application
  FROM node:14.16.1-alpine3.13 as build

  # Docker work directory, docker will create an `/app` folder and all the next steps will happen in this directory
  WORKDIR /app

  # Copy your application to the container
  COPY . /app/

  # Prepare the container for building React
  RUN npm install
  # Build your application
  RUN npm run build

  # Nginx stage: deploy build/compiled app to Nginx.
  #Prepare nginx
  FROM nginx:1.19.10-alpine

  # Copy application build files from build stage above to nginx
  COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

  # Delete the default Nginx configration file and copy your Nginx configuration file to the container
  RUN rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
  COPY nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d

  #Fire up the Nginx
  EXPOSE 80

  #If you add a custom CMD in the Dockerfile, be sure to include -g daemon off; in the CMD in order for nginx to stay in the foreground, so that Docker can track the process properly (otherwise your container will stop immediately after starting)!
  CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
  ```

- Create Nginx configuration file

  You can see from the above step that we use our own nginx configration file. So that your root of the porject, create a folder called `nginx` add the below nginx configuration code and named it `nginx.conf`

  ```
  server {
      listen 80;

      location / {
          root /usr/share/nginx/html;
          index index.html index.htm;
          try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
      }

      error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;

      location /50x.html {
          root /usr/share/nginx/html;
      }
  }
  ```

- Now, we try to create our docker image locally to see if all above steps work.

  Open your project, if you create the files correctly, your project file structure should look like as below

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116006377-83d62f00-a63d-11eb-9f0b-9e7ceb151e55.png)

  Now open the terminal and make sure you are at the root of your project folder and run

  ```
  docker build -t bright-future:1.0 .
  ```

  Docker will output lots of log messages, and if we create our image successfully, we can check the image by using

  ```
  docker images
  ```

  if you see the below line, we can verify that we have created a nginx dcoker with out application
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116007288-a0746600-a641-11eb-81b4-f1ed9466f324.png)

  Fire up a docker container based on the image we created

  ```
  docker run -d --rm --name bright-future -p 5000:80 -t bright-future:1.0
  ```

  Now you can go to http://localhost:5000 and see our dockerlised app running.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116007341-e92c1f00-a641-11eb-8d5d-a0817a32fbf6.png)

## 5. Gitlab Pipelines

Gitlab uses `gitlab-ci.yml` to run the pipelines. So we need to create a `gitlab-ci.yml` file at the root of the project folder.

Once we added the `gitlab-ci.yml` file and push it to the Gitlab repository, Gitlab will detect this file and Gitlab-runner will go through the file and run all jobs that we specific there.

In this article, we will create 4 stages as example to demonstrate how Gitlab pipeline works

- build
- test
- docker-build
- deploy

### 5.1 Pipelines - build

Let's first create a build stage for pipelines. See the below example:

```
stages:
  - build

build:
  stage: build
  image: node:14.16.1-alpine3.13
  before_script:
    - echo "Start building app..."
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
    - echo "Build successfully"
```

Commit and push your code to your self-hosted Gitlab. You will see there is a `build` stage on your project piplines.

<img width="634" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116027198-d12abe80-a686-11eb-95e9-c2a60197aeba.png" />

If everything runs well, it should show `passed`.

<img width="628" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116027270-00d9c680-a687-11eb-88af-6e26207e453d.png"/>

### 5.2 Pipelines - test

After `build`, we should add a test stage to check if all the test pass.

```
stages:
  - build
  - test

build:
  stage: build
  image: node:14.16.1-alpine3.13
  before_script:
    - echo "Start building app..."
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
    - echo "Build successfully"

test:
  stage: test
  image: node:14.16.1-alpine3.13
  before_script:
    - echo "Start testing app..."
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test
    - echo "Test successfully!"


```

Commit and push your code, the test stage will also be added on the piplines

<img width="661" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116028981-e3a6f700-a68a-11eb-93e6-7986a59f1285.png"/>

If everything runs well, both build and test should show `passed`.

<img width="579" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116029154-3da7bc80-a68b-11eb-980d-ef349068c09b.png"/>

Till now, we have 2 stages (build and test) to show how piplines work. We build the app at first and then run the test in sequence. You might be curious why we run `npm install` two times in two stages? That is because each job runs in a new empty docker container instance and we don't have any data from previous jobs. In order to share data among stages, we need to use artifacts or cache, what is the difference? Here is the answer from Gitlab offical document.

> **Cache vs artifacts**
>
> If you use cache and artifacts to store the same path in your jobs, the cache might be overwritten because caches are restored before artifacts.
> Don’t use caching for passing artifacts between stages, as it is designed to store runtime dependencies needed to compile the project:
>
> - `cache`: **For storing project dependencies**
>   Caches can increase the speed of a given job in subsequent pipelines. You can store downloaded dependencies so that they don’t have to be fetched from the internet again. Dependencies include things like npm packages, Go vendor packages, and so on. You can configure a cache to pass intermediate build results between stages, but you should use artifacts instead.
> - `artifacts`: **Use for stage results that are passed between stages.**
>   Artifacts are files that are generated by a job so they can be stored and uploaded. You can fetch and use artifacts in jobs in later stages of the same pipeline. You can’t create an artifact in a job in one stage, and use this artifact in a different job in the same stage. This data is not available in different pipelines, but can be downloaded from the UI.
>
> If you download modules while building your application, you can declare them as artifacts and subsequent stage jobs can use them.
>
> You can define an expiry time so artifacts are deleted after a defined time. Use dependencies to control which jobs fetch the artifacts.
>
> Artifacts can also be used to make files available for download after a pipeline completes, like a build image.

Let's improve our script with below code:

```yml
stages:
  - build
  - test

build:
  stage: build
  image: node:14.16.1-alpine3.13
  before_script:
    - echo "Start building app..."
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
    - echo "Build successfully"
  artifacts:
    expire_in: 1 hour
    paths:
      - build
      - node_modules/

test:
  stage: test
  image: node:14.16.1-alpine3.13
  before_script:
    - echo "Start testing app..."
  script:
    - npm test
    - echo "Test successfully!"
```

Commit and push your code, you should get the same result but more faster.

### 5.3 Pipelines - Docker Build

Now it's time to dockerlise our project in a Nginx docker image just like what we did at step 3. We will use docker in docker to buid this image.

**_IMPORTANT:_**
Based on the offical document [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html),

> If you want to use Docker-in-Docker, you must always use privileged = true in your Docker containers.

So we should register a new runner with `privileged` enabled.

```
sudo gitlab-runner register -n --url https://gitlab.yourdomian.com/ --registration-token REGISTRATION_TOKEN --executor docker --description "My Docker Runner" --docker-image "docker:20.10.6-dind"  --docker-privileged --docker-volumes "/certs/client"
```

otherwise, you probably get an error like below when running the pipelines process

```
error during connect: Post http://docker:2375/v1.24/auth: dial tcp: lookup docker on 168.63.129.16:53: no such host
Cleaning up file based variables
00:01
ERROR: Job failed: exit code 1
```

<img width="806" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116033306-c3c80100-a693-11eb-80b6-c55b9c77313a.png"/>

**_Note:_**
If you register a new runner with `privileged` enabled, you should use this new runner to run the docker in docker jobs. You may can choose to delete the older runner in `/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml` file or using gitlab-runner `tags` to specify which runner to excute which specific jobs with the same `tags`.

Add the below code to your `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - docker-build

build:
  stage: build
  image: node:14.16.1-alpine3.13
  before_script:
    - echo "Start building app..."
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
    - echo "Build successfully"
  artifacts:
    expire_in: 1 hour
    paths:
      - build
      - node_modules/

test:
  stage: test
  image: node:14.16.1-alpine3.13
  before_script:
    - echo "Start testing app..."
  script:
    - npm test
    - echo "Test successfully!"

docker-build:
  stage: docker-build
  image: docker:latest
  services:
    - name: docker:20.10.6-dind
  before_script:
    - docker login --username "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" --password "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" $CI_REGISTRY
  script:
    - docker build --pull -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE .
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE
    - echo "Registry Image:" $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE
```

Commit and push your code. You will see a new `docker-build` is added and passed.

<img width="729" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116048363-aef56880-a6a7-11eb-8dd9-5b5f8caec46e.png"/>

Now go to your project side bar and click `Packages & Registries` -> `Container Registry`, you will also find the image that you just built by docker in docker has been uploaded to your project `Container Registry`.

<img width="1016" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116048664-f976e500-a6a7-11eb-8956-c8187818a2af.png"/>

**Predefined Environment Variables:**

In this section, we also use Gitlab [Predefined Environment Variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html). I listed the ones that we used in this phase at below:

- **CI_REGISTRY_USER -** The username to push containers to the project’s GitLab Container Registry. Only available if the Container Registry is enabled for the project.

- **CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD -** The password to push containers to the project’s GitLab Container Registry. Only available if the Container Registry is enabled for the project.

- **CI_REGISTRY -** The address of the GitLab Container Registry. Only available if the Container Registry is enabled for the project. This variable includes a :port value if one is specified in the registry configuration.

- **CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE -** The address of the project’s Container Registry. Only available if the Container Registry is enabled for the project.

### 5.4 Pipelines - deploy

With the docker images that we uploaded to project container registry, we can deploy our application either on the server or a cloud platform

#### 5.4.1 Deploy to a server

If you have your personal server, you can deploy your app on your own app. The article that I refered uses `Digital Ocean` to set up a new server. You can click this [link](https://dev.to/christianmontero/gitlab-ci-cd-example-with-a-dockerized-reactjs-app-1cda) to check the details. You can of course choose other VPS providers like `Linode` and `Vultr` or cloud providers like `Azure` and `AWS`.

- Open your terminal and login to your server remotely with

  ```
  ssh root@<server_ip>
  ```

- [Install the Docker ](https://dev.to/christianmontero/gitlab-ci-cd-example-with-a-dockerized-reactjs-app-1cda) on the server

- Let's try to pull the image from our `Container Registry` and check if the image has been built successfully.

  - Open the project on the Gitlab
  - Go to `Packages & Registry` -> `Container Registry`
  - Click `CLI Commands` on the top right and find the registry information
    <img width="315" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116053285-17931400-a6ad-11eb-838e-634191431d2c.png" />
  - Go back to your deploy server, and login the container registry by

    ```
    docker login gitlab.<yourdomain>.com:5050
    ```

  - Input your `username` and `password`
  - Pull image with using

    ```
    docker pull gitlab.<yourdomain>.com: 5050/root/bright-future[:tag]
    ```

    Run `docker ps -a` to check if image has been downloaded successfully.

  - You can run the docker container manully by
    `docker run -p 8000:80 -d --name bright-future gitlab.<yourdomain>.com:5050/root/bright-future`
    If above steps run very well, you can see your `bright-future` has been deployed manully on `http://your_server_ip:8000`.

    <img width="1350" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116056022-e700a980-a6af-11eb-95fd-1ce0e910bafd.png" />

  **_Note:_** If your VPS/Cloud Providers has their own port security rules, the port 8000 might be blocked and need you to open it by yourself.

  Now that we verify that our server is running perfectly and we can run our app there. Next, we need to store our server's ssh private key and IP address as an environment variable in our GitLab project so that our Gitlab can access the deploy server remotely, like how we login the server by opening a terminal.

- Create your ssh private/public key pairs on your server by

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```

  It will ask you for a file to save the key, just type enter to use the default one, then it will ask you for a passphrase, for this example let's leave it empty and press enter a couple of times, and then you will see a successful message, then we need to copy our private key add it to our project on GitLab, we can run this command to see the our private key.

- Check your ssh private key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`

  ```
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

  Copy all the content from the terminal

  ```
  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  MIIJKAIBAAKCAgEArPK6v04pwEn1xkGy4CCMkA6pNafxs4S8xKM6iq8aXE00ka6z
  ...
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ```

- Open your project on gitlab. On the side bar, Click `Settings` -> `CI/CD` -> `Variables` -> `Expand`.

  - Click the `Add Variable` button.
  - Input `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` as Key
  - Input copied private key from above step as value
  - Choose Type as `File`
    <img width="768" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116058612-96d71680-a6b2-11eb-8674-facfe934e355.png" />
  - Click `Add Variable` to save the variable.

- Then we add another varialbe called `SERVER_IP` with your <server_ip> as value. Choose Type as `Variable`.

    <img width="768" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116061331-5036eb80-a6b5-11eb-9568-06180b4107cd.png" />

  Finally, you will have two variables added to your project on Gitlab.

    <img width="911" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116061498-82484d80-a6b5-11eb-8dce-60c84e113586.png" />

- Add the below script to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

  ```
  stages:
  - build
  - test
  - docker-build
  - deploy

  build:
  stage: build
  image: node:14.16.1-alpine3.13
  before_script:
      - echo "Start building app..."
  script:
      - npm install
      - npm run build
      - echo "Build successfully"
  artifacts:
      expire_in: 1 hour
      paths:
      - build
      - node_modules/

  test:
  stage: test
  image: node:14.16.1-alpine3.13
  before_script:
      - echo "Start testing app..."
  script:
      - npm test
      - echo "Test successfully!"

  docker-build:
  stage: docker-build
  image: docker:latest
  services:
      - name: docker:20.10.6-dind
  before_script:
      - docker login --username "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" --password "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" $CI_REGISTRY
  script:
      - docker build --pull -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE .
      - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE
      - echo "Registry Image:" $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE

  deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: kroniak/ssh-client
  before_script:
      - echo "Deploying app for development environment"
  script:
      - chmod 400 $SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
      - ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i $SSH_PRIVATE_KEY root@$SERVER_IP "docker login --username "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" --password "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" $CI_REGISTRY"
      - ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i $SSH_PRIVATE_KEY root@$SERVER_IP "docker pull $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE"
      - ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i $SSH_PRIVATE_KEY root@$SERVER_IP "docker stop bright-future || true && docker rm bright-future || true"
      - ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i $SSH_PRIVATE_KEY root@$SERVER_IP "docker run -p 80:80 -d --rm --name bright-future $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE"
  ```

  What are we doing at the deploy stage?

  In order to make auto deploy happens, we need to establish a ssh connection between our pipeline and our server.

  You can think that now gitlab login to our server remotely and pull the image from our Gitlab `Container Registry` and run the docker container that contains our application

  We use an image with a ssh client (kroniak/ssh-client) and run our commands one by one.

  ### Congratulations!

  If you follow the steps correctly, I think you have setup a simple CI/CD pipelines for a ReactJS project on your self-hosted Gitlab repostory.

  Now if you made some changes locally and push these changes to your Gitlab on master branch. Your app will also be deployed in a docker Nginx container on your server automatically.

#### 5.4.2 Deploy to Azure App Service

You can also choose to deploy your application from your project `Container Registry` to an Azure app service.

- Then

  **Option 1:**

  You ccan choose to use `Docker Hub` instead of Gitlab `Container Registry`. So in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, insteading of pushing image to `Container Registry` at `docker-build` stage, you should push your image to `Docker Hub` with code

  ```
  docker-build:
    stage: docker-build
    image: docker:latest
    services:
      - name: docker:20.10.6-dind
    before_script:
      - docker login -u "$DOCKER_USER" -p "$DOCKER_PASSWORD"
    script:
      - docker build --pull -t "$DOCKER_USER/$DOCKER_REGISTRY_IMAGE" .
      - docker push "$DOCKER_USER/$DOCKER_REGISTRY_IMAGE"
      - echo "Registry Image:" $DOCKER_REGISTRY_IMAGE
  ```

  Where `DOCKER_USER` `DOCKER_PASSWORD` and `DOCKER_REGISTRY_IMAGE` are the variables added to your pipeline variables for `Docker login user`, `Docker login password` and `Docker image name`

  And Skip the `deploy` stage at the `.gitlab-ci.yml`

  Then add Azure App Servicce Webhook URL

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116197425-54234600-a767-11eb-821c-e99eb5ecaea4.png)

  to Docker Hub of your repositry.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116197789-bda35480-a767-11eb-9981-428ff3579977.png)

  Then when you push a new image to the docker hub, the Azure App Serivce will deploy your application from Docker Hub immediately.

  **Option 2:**

  You can also use `Pipeline events` to trigger the Azure App Serivce Webhook to force `App Serivce` to deploy your app from Gitlab Rigstry.

  Go to your project `Settings` -> `Webhooks`, fill the `URL` with app service `Webhook URL` and tick `Pipeline events`

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10986601/116210087-234a0d80-a775-11eb-97ac-2cebd0b8ea54.png)

  And click `Add webhook` button to save the configuration.

  This means App Service Webhook URL will be triggered when the pipeline status changes, from `running` to either `passed` or `failed`. If it is `failed`, the image will not be uploaded to `Container Registry` and app service will use the last build. If it is `passed`, app service will pull the latest image to deploy the app.

  ### Congratulations!

  Now you can made some changes on your code and push it to Gitlab. You will see your changes will be applied on Azure App Service.
