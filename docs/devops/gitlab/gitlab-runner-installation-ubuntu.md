# Install Gitlab Runner on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

_Reference:_ [Install GitLab Runner manually on GNU/Linux](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/linux-manually.html)

## Prerequirement:

1. Before installing the gitlab-runner, Please [install Docker](https://github.com/PFTian/TechNotes/blob/master/Docker/Docker%20Installation.md) at first.

2. Notice:

   > We strongly advise against installing GitLab Runner on the same machine you plan to install GitLab on. Depending on how you decide to configure GitLab Runner and what tools you use to exercise your application in the CI environment, GitLab Runner can consume significant amount of available memory.

   > Memory consumption calculations, that are available above, will not be valid if you decide to run GitLab Runner and the GitLab Rails application on the same machine.

   > It is also not safe to install everything on a single machine, because of the security reasons - especially when you plan to use shell executor with GitLab Runner.

   > We recommend using a separate machine for each GitLab Runner, if you plan to use the CI features.
